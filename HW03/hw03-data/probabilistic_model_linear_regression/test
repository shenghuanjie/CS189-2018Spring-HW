def lstsq(a, b, rcond=-1):
    """
    Return the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation.
    Solves the equation `a x = b` by computing a vector `x` that
    minimizes the Euclidean 2-norm `|| b - a x ||^2`.  The equation may
    be under-, well-, or over- determined (i.e., the number of
    linearly independent rows of `a` can be less than, equal to, or
    greater than its number of linearly independent columns).  If `a`
    is square and of full rank, then `x` (but for round-off error) is
    the "exact" solution of the equation.
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (M, N) array_like
        "Coefficient" matrix.
    b : {(M,), (M, K)} array_like
        Ordinate or "dependent variable" values. If `b` is two-dimensional,
        the least-squares solution is calculated for each of the `K` columns
        of `b`.
    rcond : float, optional
        Cut-off ratio for small singular values of `a`.
        For the purposes of rank determination, singular values are treated
        as zero if they are smaller than `rcond` times the largest singular
        value of `a`.
    Returns
    -------
    x : {(N,), (N, K)} ndarray
        Least-squares solution. If `b` is two-dimensional,
        the solutions are in the `K` columns of `x`.
    residuals : {(), (1,), (K,)} ndarray
        Sums of residuals; squared Euclidean 2-norm for each column in
        ``b - a*x``.
        If the rank of `a` is < N or M <= N, this is an empty array.
        If `b` is 1-dimensional, this is a (1,) shape array.
        Otherwise the shape is (K,).
    rank : int
        Rank of matrix `a`.
    s : (min(M, N),) ndarray
        Singular values of `a`.
    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If computation does not converge.
    Notes
    -----
    If `b` is a matrix, then all array results are returned as matrices.
    Examples
    --------
    Fit a line, ``y = mx + c``, through some noisy data-points:
    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([-1, 0.2, 0.9, 2.1])
    By examining the coefficients, we see that the line should have a
    gradient of roughly 1 and cut the y-axis at, more or less, -1.
    We can rewrite the line equation as ``y = Ap``, where ``A = [[x 1]]``
    and ``p = [[m], [c]]``.  Now use `lstsq` to solve for `p`:
    >>> A = np.vstack([x, np.ones(len(x))]).T
    >>> A
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  1.],
           [ 3.,  1.]])
    >>> m, c = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y)[0]
    >>> print(m, c)
    1.0 -0.95
    Plot the data along with the fitted line:
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='Original data', markersize=10)
    >>> plt.plot(x, m*x + c, 'r', label='Fitted line')
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()
